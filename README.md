#INSTRUCTIONS:

Start the iPhone app
Wait for it to fully load, and for about 10-30 seconds.
Start the OS X app on your Macintosh with Bluetooth 4.0 capabilities in a new XCode window
If you repeatedly see `Services: nil` in the OS X Xcode terminal after a a few seconds (5-30 seconds), stop the iPhone application, and then restart it.

If you see `ROBOT ARM JOINT POSITION READY`, the computer is ready to receive rotation data.

Bluetooth data for each arm's position should begin to transmit to the OS X Xcode terminal each time one is moved.

Move the arms by sliding up and down on the arms, starting from the bottom or starting from the top.

Change the background by swiping across the bottom of the screen.
